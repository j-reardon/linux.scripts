# linux.scripts

This is a collection of all the scripts that I have thrown together. Feel free to use any of them. 
Some of them will be distro agnostic, some of them will be specific to Archlinux. While I try to
write all of my code as generic as possible, sometimes I fail to do so or sometimes I'm in a
hurry. I suggest to read through everything to make sure you understand what it's doing. Use at
your own risk ;)
